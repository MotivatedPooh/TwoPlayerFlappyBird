# TwoPlayerFlappyBird

A modern take on a two-player version of the classic Flappy Bird game, built using Processing. Players control their birds simultaneously, dodging Mario-inspired pipes to see who can fly the furthest without crashing.

## Features
- Two-player gameplay on the same keyboard
- Real-time collision detection with pipes
- Simple controls
- Engaging visuals created with Processing

## Technologies Used
- Processing (Java-based creative coding environment)

## How to Play
1. Download and install [Processing](https://processing.org/download)
2. Open the 'twoplayerflappybird.pde` file in Processing
3. Controls:
   - Player 1: Press **W** to flap
   - Player 2: Press **UP ARROW** to flap
4. Avoid the pipes and try to "out-flap" the other player!

## Potential Improvisions
- Add sound effects and background music
- Implement online multiplayer support
- Implement real Flappy Bird models instead of circles
- Introduce power-ups and moving obstacles
- Improve UI with start, pause, game-over, and restart options
